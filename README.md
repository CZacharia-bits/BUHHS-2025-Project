# BUHHS-2025-Project
Project-0 , Project for BUHHS 2025 

All code for our CNN was created originally by Myself and Eren Safar. (Please note to train the CNN we used the Trashnet dataset, which can be found here:https://github.com/garythung/trashnet). We were able to achieve a 96% test Accuracy. :-) 

The hack.py contains the code for our CNN. test-image.py can be used to test your own image. (please note we did not have enough time to fully test our test-image.py code)
